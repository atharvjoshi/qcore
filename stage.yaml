# collection of yaml schema for qcrew's experimental stage
# stage refers to the set of instruments used in a typical experiment
# we include both physical hardware (e.g. OPX, LabBrick)
# as well as 'meta'-instruments (e.g. qubit, resonator)
# ~ refer to Python None values
# any values explicitly specified here most likely don't need to be changed

# TODO refer to tutorial on how to use this file
